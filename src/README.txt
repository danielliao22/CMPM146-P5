Search:
    In this search function, we implement an A* algorithm that is slightly modified to 
    work with the changing state that is implemented in our make effect function. We 
    use the actions that are returned in said function in a list that we run through
    to return the desired list of tuples.

Hueristic:
    In this algorithm, we try and think like how a normal player would play in minecraft.
    We basically deprioritze certain things depending on how far into the game we are. We
    Also cap certain resources so it forces our player to build instead of mining for more
    useless resources.
